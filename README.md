# IOMemory-VSL4
This is an "unsupported" updated, and cleaned up version of the original driver
source for newer generation FusionIO cards. It comes with no warranty, it may
cause DATA LOSS or CORRUPTION.

# IOMemory-VSL(3)
For the iomemory-vsl driver please go to the [iomemory-vsl](https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl) repo.

# How to Identify your Fusion-io Card (including VSL version)
 Please refer to the [Fusion-io and OEM Part Numbers Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQMd40liekOCeftUYQx6GeofHgjU5SSDT-jHWid03JCfswQxHAhVee3rW-04baqKg1qN2fp7wEzuFm6/pubhtml).

## Background
Driver support for FusionIO cards has been lagging behind kernel
releases, effectively making these cards an expensive paperweight
when running a distribution like Ubuntu / Arch / Fedora / ProxMox which
all supply newer kernels than supported.

## Current version
The current driver version is derived from iomemory-vsl-4.3.7.1205, and has
gone through rigorous rewriting and cleaning of redundant, unused, and old code.
This driver is aimed to support Linux kernels from 5.0 and upwards.

### Releases
We've abandoned the notion of releases, Generally `main` should be checked out. `main` is completely backwards compatible for all **5**, and **6** kernels. The latest working tested kernel is **6.5**.

Historically releases were tagged, and were be checked out by their tag. The release tags follow Linux Kernel versions. E.g. **v5.12.1 (Boop Noodle)** will work on all 5.x kernels that are 5.12 and lower, but is not guaranteed to work on 5.13. **v4.20.2 - Big Ole Nope Rope** supports most kernels that pre-date 5.0. Again this way of following kernel releases has been abandoned. Please follow **main**.

| Tag | Codename |
| --- | --- |
| main | |
| v5.12.1 | Boop Noodle |
| v5.10.0 | Spicy Nope Rope |
| v5.6.1 | Danger Noodle |
| v4.20.1 | Big Ole Nope Rope |

## Important Note for newer Linux Kernels
Starting with Linux kernel 5.4.0, significant changes to the kernel were made that require additional boot time kernel flags for this driver to work. These affect AMD CPUs starting with 5.4.0, and Intel CPUs after about kernel 5.8.0. 

Add the following to your /etc/default/grub by looking for `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""` and adding additional parameters inside the quotes.
For AMD systems:
```
amd_iommu=on iommu=pt
```
For Intel system:
```
iommu=pt
```

Example:
```GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet iommu=pt"```

### Supported Hardware
Here's a not so exhaustive list of iomemory cards. I have only tested the 3.2TB card, and was able to crossflash back to OEM. The rest below all seem to be SX350s or PX600s. While they should all work, we don't have any PX or SX300 cards to test with.

## Important notes!!!
At this moment the driver has been tested over time with different kernel version. 
Tests are run on an LVM volume with an ext4 filesystem. Workload testing is done with
VM's, Containers, FIO and normal desktop usage.

## Building
There are several ways to build and package the module.

Note! For many systems, the best option is to use DKMS, using the [DKMS instructions below](https://github.com/RemixVSL/iomemory-vsl4/blob/main/README.md#dkms). If you prefer to build the module directly, or to create a dpkg or rpm package, you can proceed with the options below.

Please make sure that the required dependencies are installed, as mentioned in this [README](https://github.com/RemixVSL/iomemory-vsl4/blob/main/README)

### From Source
```
git clone https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl4
cd iomemory-vsl4/
# OPTIONAL: Checkout a specific release. Usually using main branch is correct.
# DO THIS ONLY IF YOU'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S REQUIRED!
# git checkout <release-tag>
make module
cd root/usr/src/iomemory-vsl4-4.3.7
sudo insmod iomemory-vsl4.ko
```

### .deb Ubuntu / Debian
```
git clone https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl4
cd iomemory-vsl4/
# OPTIONAL: Checkout a specific release. Usually using main branch is correct.
# DO THIS ONLY IF YOU'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S REQUIRED!
# git checkout <release-tag>
make dpkg
```

### .rpm CentOS / RHEL
```
git clone https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl4
cd iomemory-vsl4/
# OPTIONAL: Checkout a specific release. Usually using main branch is correct.
# DO THIS ONLY IF YOU'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S REQUIRED!
# git checkout <release-tag>
make rpm
```

## Installation
Installation can be done with created packages, DKMS or other options described
in the original README.

## DKMS
Dynamic Kernel Module Support automates away the requirement of having to
repackage the kernel module with every kernel and headers update that takes
place on the system.

Try building from `main` first as it works with most modern kernels up to about 5.14:

```
git clone https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl4
cd iomemory-vsl4/
make dkms
```

If you know you need to build a specific branch based on a specific recommendation, use:

```
git clone https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl4
cd iomemory-vsl4/
git checkout <release-tag>
make dkms
```
